# ImageDenoisingNN3D
This contains the Image denoising method with CNNs (FFDNet) and Non Local Filter (NLF) in which we propose a python implementation of this model.

This project is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02112.pdf. This article having
for the title "Nonlocality-Reinforced Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Denoising" combines
Non-local patch methods and neural network denoising methods con-
(CNN) for image noise reduction. In this project we first analyse
the above-mentioned article and then propose an implementation of their algorithm on python using
mainly the FFDNET network.


To reproduce our experience on NN3D
if you do not use drive, you can skip the step of connecting the notebook NNBM.ipynb to google drive
install all libraries at the beginning of the notebook
- Set the direction or path to Project_image by doing % cd /Project_image in the Data part (Set12) of the notebook, otherwise change it appropriately.
