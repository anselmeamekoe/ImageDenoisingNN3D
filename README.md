# ImageDenoisingNN3D
This contains the Image denoising method with CNNs (FFDNet) and Non Local Filter (NLF) in which we propose a python implementation of this model.

This project is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02112.pdf. This article having
for the title "Nonlocality-Reinforced Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Denoising" combines
Non-local patch methods and neural network denoising methods con-
(CNN) for image noise reduction. In this project we first analyse
the above-mentioned article and then propose an implementation of their algorithm on python using
mainly the FFDNET network.
